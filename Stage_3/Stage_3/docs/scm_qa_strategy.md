# StellarStudio SCM & QA Strategy

## Source Control Management

### Current Git Flow
```
main
├── feature/backend
├── feature/frontend
└── feature/monitoring
```

### Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `feature/*`: Feature development branches
  - `feature/backend`: Backend development and documentation
  - `feature/frontend`: Frontend development
  - `feature/monitoring`: Monitoring implementation

### Development Workflow
1. Development in feature branches
2. Regular commits with clear messages
3. Code review before merge to main
4. No direct commits to main

## Quality Assurance

### Quality Objectives
- Reliable astronomical data processing
- Secure user data handling
- Optimal system performance
- Consistent user experience

### Current Testing Status
- Manual testing of features
- Basic error handling
- Local development validation

### Future Testing Implementation (Post-MVP)
- Implementation of automated tests
- API endpoint validation
- User interface testing
- Performance metrics collection

### Current Monitoring
- Basic system monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana
- Docker container health checks

### Quality Metrics
#### System Performance
- Processing completion times
- API response latency
- Resource utilization

#### Data Quality
- Image processing accuracy
- Catalog data integrity
- Storage reliability

### Risk Management
