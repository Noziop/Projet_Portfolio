## Overview
StellarStudio is an innovative web platform dedicated to astronomical image processing, designed to meet the needs of astrophotographers of all levels. Our solution provides an intuitive interface and powerful tools to transform raw data into stunning cosmic images.

## MVP Focus (March 2025)
Our initial release focuses on beginners in astrophotography by providing:
- Direct integration with NASA/MAST catalog
- Automated pre-processing workflows
- Simple and intuitive interface
- Predefined processing templates

## Project Goals
- Democratize astronomical image processing
- Provide automated workflows for beginners
- Deliver advanced tools for experts
- Build an astrophotographer community

## Technical Stack
### Backend
- FastAPI for RESTful API
- Celery + Redis for async tasks
- MariaDB as database
- MinIO for image storage

### Frontend
- Vue.js 3 with Vuetify
- Planned migration to Vite
- Three.js for 3D visualization

### Image Processing
- AstroPy for FITS files
- OpenCV and NumPy for processing

## Key Features
- Predefined catalog of astronomical targets (HST (Hubble Space Telescope) and JWST (James Webb Space Telescope))
- Automated preprocessing (dark, flat, bias)
- Image alignment and stacking
- Advanced processing techniques 
    - ABE (Automatic Background Extraction)
    - HOO (Hydrogen/OIII oxygen palette)
    - SHO (Hubble Space Telescope palette - S-II, H-alpha, O-III)
- 3D visualization of astronomical objects (MVP feature if time permits)

## Development Status
Currently in active development with:
- Core architecture implementation
- Basic authentication system
- NASA/MAST API integration
- Automated pre-processing pipeline
