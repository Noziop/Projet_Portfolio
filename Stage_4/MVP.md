# MVP Development and Execution for StellarStudio: Agile Approach

## Understanding Agile MVP Development

An MVP (Minimum Viable Product) in Agile methodology refers to creating a basic version of your product with just enough features to satisfy early users and collect valuable feedback. For StellarStudio, this means implementing core astronomical image processing features that will create the "wow effect" needed for our DemoDay on March 13th.

The beauty of combining MVP with Agile is that it shortens time to market without sacrificing quality. Through structured development sprints and intense team collaboration, this approach allows us to gather feedback early and iterate quickly toward our final product.

## Planning and Defining Sprints

### Step 1: Identify Core Problems Worth Solving

For StellarStudio, we've identified these core problems:
- Astronomical image processing is too complex for beginners
- Experts need efficient workflows with predetermined presets (HOO, SHO, HaRVB)
- Users need intuitive visualization of astronomical data

### Step 2: Feature Prioritization

Using the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have), we've prioritized our features:

**Must Have:**
- Image upload system (FITS → MinIO → DB)
- Basic processing workflows via Celery
- HOO preset functionality
- Simple 3D visualization with Three.js

**Should Have:**
- User-friendly UI with Vuetify
- GET /presets endpoint
- Processing status indicators

**Could Have:**
- Additional presets (SHO, HaRVB)
- Advanced visualization options

**Won't Have (for MVP):**
- Advanced custom processing options
- User accounts with saved settings

### Step 3: Sprint Structure

We'll divide our work into two-week sprints, with the following timeline before DemoDay:

**Sprint 1 (Feb 14-Feb 28):**
- Backend: Implement OpenCV/NumPy in app/tasks/processing.py
- Backend: Add GET /presets endpoint
- Frontend: Create ProcessingControls.vue skeleton

**Sprint 2 (Mar 1-Mar 13):**
- Frontend: Complete PresetGallery.vue and NebulaEffect.vue (Three.js)
- Integration: Connect all components for the demo scenario
- Testing: End-to-end workflow validation
- Deployment: Final configuration with Traefik for HTTPS

## Executing Development Tasks

### Daily Workflow

For each sprint, we'll follow the Scrum methodology with:

1. **Daily Stand-ups (10-15 minutes):**
   - What was accomplished yesterday?
   - What will be worked on today?
   - Any blockers or challenges?

2. **Sprint Backlog Management:**
   - Tasks tracked in Kanban board with To Do, In Progress, Review, and Done columns
   - Clear assignment of responsibilities
   - Detailed acceptance criteria for each task

3. **Development Practices:**
   - Feature branching with pull request reviews
   - Continuous integration and testing
   - Documentation of API endpoints and components

### Quality Assurance

Quality is maintained through:
- Unit tests for processing functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end testing of complete workflows
- Monitoring via Prometheus/Grafana
- Code reviews before merging

## Monitoring Progress and Making Adjustments

### Key Metrics

We'll track:
- Sprint velocity (story points completed per sprint)
- Bug rate and resolution time
- Task completion percentage
- Build/deployment success rate

### Adaptation Strategy

The Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop will guide our development:

1. **Build:** Deliver working increments of StellarStudio quickly
2. **Measure:** Track usage patterns and gather feedback from test users
3. **Learn:** Implement improvements based on feedback

If we encounter challenges, we'll adapt by:
- Reassessing task priorities
- Reallocating resources
- Adjusting sprint goals while maintaining core MVP features

## Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives

### Sprint Review

At the end of each sprint, we'll:
- Demo completed features to stakeholders
- Gather feedback on functionality and usability
- Validate that we're on track for DemoDay

### Sprint Retrospective

We'll improve our process by answering:
- What went well during the sprint?
- What could be improved?
- What actions can we take to enhance our next sprint?

## Final Integration and Testing

Before DemoDay presentation, we'll ensure:

1. **Complete Integration:**
   - Full workflow: Upload → Processing → Visualization
   - All components working together seamlessly

2. **Final Testing:**
   - Performance under expected load
   - Cross-browser compatibility
   - Error handling and recovery

3. **Demo Preparation:**
   - Sample astronomical images ready for demonstration
   - Prepared script showcasing the "wow effect"
   - Backup plans for technical difficulties

## Deliverables

By March 13th, we will provide:

1. **Sprint Planning Documentation:**
   - Defined user stories
   - Sprint backlogs
   - Task assignments

2. **Source Repository:**
   - Clean, documented code
   - README with setup instructions
   - Development guidelines

3. **Bug Tracking:**
   - Organized issue tracking
   - Resolution documentation

4. **Testing Evidence:**
   - Test plans and results
   - Performance metrics
   - User acceptance validation

5. **Production Environment:**
   - Deployed application with HTTPS
   - Monitoring dashboard
   - Backup and recovery procedures
